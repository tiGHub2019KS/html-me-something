         <h2 class='introHead'>A Little Information About My First Military Home</h2> 
         <p class='intro'>Farnborough is a town in the northeastern corner of the English county of Hampshire, adjacent to the borders with Surrey and Berkshire. Farnborough used to be an isolated hamlet, and grew into a medium-sized town over the course of the 20th century. This growth was built on the back of the aviation industry; Farnborough was the site of the first powered flight in Britain, made by Samuel Cody in 1904. Today, the aerospace, defence and technology industries thrive and aviation heritage is evident all around the town. Farnborough is best known as the home of the biennial Farnborough International Airshow, which has been running since 1948. The town is also the final resting place of deposed French Emperor Napoléon III and his wife Eugénie de Montijo.</p>

      <p class='para1'>My life in England started 7 days after my wedding which took place in New Jersey. We arrived in Farnborough, England, a town in north east Hampshire, England. Actually about 38 miles from London via the M3 motorway. My husband was in the Army and was to begin 
</html>3 years as an exchange officer attached to the Royal Air Force working at the Royal Aircraft Establishment. Since we were attached to the Royal Air Force, oh I was informed that I was not actually attached to anything but my husband, anyway we lived in British Air Force housing instead of being on an American base. Except for no air conditioning, very cool. Also, being a military wife, I was expected to memorize all my husbands information since mine didn't matter. They just needed to know who to call or return the body to in an emergency. That was very reassuring to a new wife. Everything we needed in our housing was furnished and if we needed something we just called and it showed up. My husband went there a month before the wedding to get everything ready. We had to do a justice of the peace ceremony before the actual church wedding since the military will not give you married quarters unless you are really married not just getting married. Who knew they were so cynical. My husband went to the store to get a toaster, an electric kettle and a coffee maker thereby discovering that he had to look at the type of outlets in the house and go back and buy plugs to attach to the appliances. We lived in a great cul de sac with neighbors from all over the world. I could walk to three train stations going in any direction I desired. I do miss the kind of public transportation available there. The Underground system was very easy to understand and travel. A word about umbrellas. I lost more umbrellas in England than I have owned here in my entire life. I lost my favorite and went to the station in London and asked if they were ever turned in. He said, of course, and took me to a lost and found room the size if a small bedroom. When he opened the door it was overflowing with umbrellas. He asked me if any looked like mine and I chose one that did and thanked him. If I would have had a cell phone then I would have taken a picture./p>

I was issued an ID that only permitted me to go there. They offered numerous tours around London and all manner of interesting places. You can see so many things without having to travel days. The meetings always had tea and biscuits(cookies to us) and sherry even though it was 10 am. On one occasion we were to tour the Wind Tunnel (the picture on the left is the view looking into wind tunnel). It was rented by military from numerous countries to do wind tunnel studies on aircraft. On the day we were scheduled to tour, I was not permitted in the control room. It seems the Russians were conducting experiments and I was an American, so I might memorize whatever settings were on the console.  The guards stood in front of the small window in the door so I couldn't peek. Weird, but true. <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Waddesden_Manor03.JPG/330px-Waddesden_Manor03.JPG" alt="Waddesdon Manor"width=200 height=200 align="right" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px;"/><p class='para3'> I did some wonderful walking tours of London. I toured Waddesdon Manor(pictured on the right), the home of the Rothschilds. People think they are rich today but these people painted their ceilings in real gold. On the bus ride to the Manor once we were on the grounds, each rolling hilltop was planted with trees that were brought from Europe as full grown trees not sapplings. I learned that many homes had windows bricked up because they were taxed. Closets were extremely small because they were taxed as rooms. I am sure that was only in the past since people had large closets but I am not sure since they called them fitted closets and they were not walk in. I have never actually looked that up. But, I did learn while touring many of the smaller castles that they didn't have large formal closets either. There were extra wide hallways between bedrooms and other rooms. When the family was in residence, the door at one end would be locked and poles would be put up to create impromptu but not actual closets.</p>
<p class='para4'>When I moved there it was at the beginning of companies using desktop computers with actual software. At that time the Apple computers were widely used since they had a packaged applications with word processing, spreadsheet and others. Through a friend a few companies discovered I knew this software and asked me to teach their employees. I was extremely fortunate to have this opportunity. I traveled all over England by train and thoroughly enjoyed meeting the people. I did discover that their work life balance was different than what I was used to. I would arrive at the office by 9:00 am ready to begin. At 10:15 am the tea trolly would be wheeled in and all stopped for tea, coffee and biscuits. Now back to work at about 10:35 or so. Then everyone broke promptly at noon for lunch that usually lasted until 1:15 or so. Most of the people drank a pint of beer for lunch. I would have needed a nap if I followed suit. This was not true of every company I went to but they were very particular about breaks throughout the day. I got to go to seaside towns, London, small quaint in the middle of nowhere towns. Yes, England has more of that than you might think.</p>
